    <p>
        I'm a Communication and Computer Engineering student at 
        Mansoura University, passionate about exploring the intersections 
        of AI, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Data Science. With a 
        strong foundation in Python, C, SQL, and Flask, I enjoy building 
        projects that blend creativity with problem-solving. I actively 
        engage in technical and PR roles, from electronics internships to 
        data science volunteering, constantly expanding my skills. Whether 
        it's developing a movie-tracking website, designing a PCB, or 
        learning backend development, I thrive on challenges and continuous 
        learning.
